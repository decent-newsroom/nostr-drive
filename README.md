# nostr-drive
A framework-agnostic PHP library that implements a filesystem-like hierarchy on Nostr using Drive events (kind:30042) and Folder events (kind:30045). It provides deterministic CRUD for drives and folders, plus membership operations (add/remove/move/reorder) over addressable event coordinates.
