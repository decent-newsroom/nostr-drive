== JSON Web Token (JWT)

A NEP based upon NIP-98.

This NEP defines the method for declaring a JWT pubkey association with a npub, over a  `kind:13004` event, signed by the associated nsec.

*Event Structure*

* The `J` tag contains the JWT public key and the public key of the author of the event. The npub in the tag must match the `pubkey` of the event, otherwise the event is invalid.
* The `content` is empty.
